# Conditions

A condition is composed of atoms. Each atom represents a "singular" condition on
a specific piece of metadata. How atoms are composed to more complex conditions
is in the scope of the representation format. For example, a condition may be an
arbitrary Boolean expression in one format. In another format, a condition may
be a sequence of atoms, representing the conjunction of the individual atoms.
